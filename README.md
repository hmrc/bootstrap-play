![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/hmrc/bootstrap-play)


This library implements basic functionality required by the platform frontend/microservices.


## Adding to your build

In your SBT build add:

```scala
resolvers += MavenRepository("HMRC-open-artefacts-maven2", "https://open.artefacts.tax.service.gov.uk/maven2")

// for frontends:
libraryDependencies += "uk.gov.hmrc" %% "bootstrap-frontend-play-xx" % "x.x.x"

// for backends:
libraryDependencies += "uk.gov.hmrc" %% "bootstrap-backend-play-xx" % "x.x.x"
```
Where `play-xx` is your version of Play (e.g. `play-28`).

You can also add the test module

```scala
libraryDependencies += "uk.gov.hmrc" %% "bootstrap-test-play-xx" % "x.x.x" % Test
```
which will provide the appropriate version of other test dependencies like `http-verbs-test` and `scalatestplus-play`.


## Configure as a frontend microservice

In your application.conf file, add:

```properties
include "frontend.conf"

# An ApplicationLoader that uses Guice to bootstrap the application.
play.application.loader = "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.ApplicationLoader"

# Primary entry point for all HTTP requests on Play applications
play.http.requestHandler = "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.http.RequestHandler"

# Provides an implementation of AuditConnector. Use `uk.gov.hmrc.play.audit.AuditModule` or create your own.
# An audit connector must be provided.
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.audit.AuditModule"

# Provides an implementation of MetricsFilter. Use `uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.graphite.GraphiteMetricsModule` or create your own.
# A metric filter must be provided
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.graphite.GraphiteMetricsModule"

# Provides an implementation and configures all filters required by a Platform frontend microservice.
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.frontend.FrontendModule"

```

And in your SBT build add:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "uk.gov.hmrc" %% "play-frontend-hmrc" % "x.x.x"
```

## Configure as a backend microservice

In your application.conf file, add:

```properties
include "backend.conf"

# An ApplicationLoader that uses Guice to bootstrap the application.
play.application.loader = "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.ApplicationLoader"

# Primary entry point for all HTTP requests on Play applications
play.http.requestHandler = "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.http.RequestHandler"

# Provides an implementation of AuditConnector. Use `uk.gov.hmrc.play.audit.AuditModule` or create your own.
# An audit connector must be provided.
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.audit.AuditModule"

# Provides an implementation of MetricsFilter. Use `uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.graphite.GraphiteMetricsModule` or create your own.
# A metric filter must be provided
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.graphite.GraphiteMetricsModule"

# Provides an implementation and configures all filters required by a Platform backend microservice.
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.backend.BackendModule"

```

## Default HTTP clients

Two http clients are available and can be injected into any connector by enabling the appropriate modules.

### uk.gov.hmrc.http.HttpClient

This is the original http client provided by http-verbs.

To use, enable the following modules in your application.conf file:

```properties
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.audit.AuditModule"
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.HttpClientModule"
```

example usage:

```scala
import uk.gov.hmrc.http.HttpClient
import javax.inject.Inject

class SomeConnector @Inject() (httpClient: HttpClient) {

  httpClient.GET[Option[MyCaseClass]]("http://localhost/my-api")
}
```

### uk.gov.hmrc.http.client.HttpClientV2

This is a new http client provided by http-verbs which supports streaming and has a more flexible API, making it simpler to enable Proxies etc.

To use, enable the following modules in your application.conf file:

```properties
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.audit.AuditModule"
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.HttpClientV2Module"
```

example usage:

```scala
import uk.gov.hmrc.http.StringContextOps
import uk.gov.hmrc.http.client.HttpClientV2
import javax.inject.Inject

class SomeConnector @Inject() (httpClientV2: HttpClientV2) {

  httpClientV2.get(url"http://localhost/my-api").execute[Option[MyCaseClass]]
}
```

Note, you can safely enable both http clients.

For documentation and more usage examples see [http-verbs](https://github.com/hmrc/http-verbs)

## User Authorisation

The library supports user authorisation on microservices

Make sure you have the following modules in your application.conf file:

```
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.audit.AuditModule"
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.HttpClientModule"
play.modules.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.AuthModule"
```

Your controller will look like this:
```scala
class MyController @Inject() (val authConnector: AuthConnector) extends BaseController with AuthorisedFunctions {

   def getSomething(): Action[AnyContent] = Action.async { implicit request â‡’
       authorised() {
         // your protected logic
       }
   }
 }
```

## MDC Logging

By default the logging MDC will be passed between threads by a custom `ExecutorService`.
While this works in both test and production configurations it _does not work_ in `Dev`
mode using the `AkkaHttpServer` in Play 2.6.

If you would like the same functionality in `Dev` mode, you must use the older
`NettyHttpServer`.

* Enable the `PlayNettyServer` plugin in your `build.sbt`
```scala
  .enablePlugins(PlayNettyServer)
```

* Set the `NettyServerProvider` in the `devSettings` of your `build.sbt`
```scala
  PlayKeys.devSettings += "play.server.provider" -> "play.core.server.NettyServerProvider"
```

* Make sure you still use the `AkkaHttpServer` in `Prod` mode by specifying it in `application.conf`
```hocon
play.server.provider = play.core.server.AkkaHttpServerProvider
```

There is a `bootstrap.mdcdataloss.warn` configuration, which is `false` by default. It will log a warning if MDC data added by `MdcFilter` is lost by the time the response is returned. Turning this on can help identify if MDC data is going missing. This often indicates that an `Mdc.preservingMdc` across an async boundary is missing.

## Changes

### Version 7.5.0

More MDC data loss fixes.

Adds `bootstrap.mdcdataloss.warn` configuration (by default is `false`) which can help identify if MDC data is going missing.

### Version 7.4.0

- `SessionIdFilter` is enabled in `frontend.conf` by default.

Any explicit addition of this filter can now be removed.

It's position by default ensures the sessionId is available to all auditing in the first request, something which isn't true if the filter is added manually at the end of the filter chain.

- `MDCFilter` is now a trait. `FrontendMdcFilter` and `BackendMdcFilter` will be bound accordingly to ensure the the data is populated consistently.

- `http-verbs` and `play-auditing` have been updated to fix some MDC data loss.

### Version 7.0.0

#### crypto

Crypto has been updated to version 7.0.0.

If clients are using `json-encryption`, they should ensure they are using at least version `5.0.0`, or `crypto-play-xx` instead for compatibility.

See [crypto](https://github.com/hmrc/crypto).

Note, `commons-codec` is no longer provided as a transitive dependency, and will need adding explicitly if clients require it.

#### form bindings

`WithDefaultFormBinding` has been removed. `WithUnsafeDefaultFormBinding` should be used instead.

### Version 6.0.0

#### http-verbs

Http-verbs has been updated to version 14.0.0, which adds `HttpClientV2`. See [http-verbs](https://github.com/hmrc/http-verbs) for details.

#### Auditing of truncated payloads

http-verbs's `HookData` has been updated to identify when audit data has been truncated. This should have little impact on clients as long as they rely on `bootstrap-play` to provide compatible versions of `http-verbs` and `play-auditing`.

`AuditFilter`s have been updated to identify when audit data has been truncated. Most clients will be using the provided AuditFilters and should not be impacted.


### Version 5.24.0

Builds update dependencies to Play 2.8.15 and Jackson 2.12.6.  Also drops support for using `bindFormRequest` with `application/json` and
`application/multipart` content types - if this is required, add `with WithUrlEncodedAndMultipartFormBinding` or `with WithDefaultFormBinding` to your
controller.

Note, that in unit tests, you will need to use `withFormUrlEncodedBody` rather than `withJsonBody`. And also ensure you are setting the correct HTTP Method, otherwise you may fall foul of CORS checks. e.g.
```scala
FakeRequest().withMethod("POST").withFormUrlEncodedBody("username" -> username)
```

Please speak to PlatOps if you have issues.

### Version 5.21.0

Builds for Scala 2.13 in addition to 2.12

### Version 5.20.0

Adds the following configuration for `JsonErrorHandler`:

- `bootstrap.errorHandler.suppress4xxErrorMessages`
- `bootstrap.errorHandler.suppress5xxErrorMessages`

It is expected that suppression will be disabled for at least development, since they provide valuable feedback, but verbose messages can be suppressed if required.

### Version 5.19.0

Drops support for Play 2.6 and Play 2.7. Only Play 2.8 is supported.

### Version 5.18.0

Adds `uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.LoggerModule`.

This has been enabled by default in `backend.conf` and `frontend.conf`, but it can be disabled with `play.modules.disabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.LoggerModule"` in your `application.conf` if required.

The LoggerModule will pick up `logger.$loggername` configuration (e.g. `logger.uk.gov.hmrc = DEBUG`) in any configuration file, not just in `System.properties`. The configuration will be applied, regardless of whether they have been defined in your logback file.

e.g. default values will suffice in your logback file without preping to use a System property:

`<logger name="uk.gov" level="${logger.uk.gov:-WARN}"/>`

can be replaced with

`<logger name="uk.gov" level="WARN"/>`

And to enable a bespoke logger, not present in the logback file, you can just turn on with configuration.
e.g. `-Dlogger.uk.gov.test=DEBUG` will set logger `uk.gov.test` to `DEBUG` without having to make a new build with updated logback file first.

### Version 5.0.0

#### auth-client

Added Identity Verification (IV) CL250 support via auth-client 5.6, see [May 2021 Tech Blog Post](https://confluence.tools.tax.service.gov.uk/display/TEC/2021/05) on this.

### Version 4.0.0

#### http-verbs

Http-verbs has been bumped to major version 13.0.0. See [http-verbs]("https://github.com/hmrc/http-verbs") for details.

#### configuration

The following configuration has been renamed, the previous keys are invalid and will need to be updated.

| Invalid config key                      | Should now be                           |
| --- | --- |
| auditing.auditExtraHeaders              | auditing.auditSentHeaders               |

#### Filters

`FrontendFilters` and `BackendFilters` have been deprecated. The preferred way to set filters is via `play.filters.enabled`.

The motivation for this is to allow configuration of default Play filters via `play.filters.enabled` as per the Play documentation, and improve visibility of which filters are actually being used.

If you are using `play.http.filters = uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.backend.filters.BackendFilters`, you will only need to remove this setting, since backend.conf has defined `play.filters.enabled` to the same filters.

If you are using `play.http.filters = uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.frontend.filters.FrontendFilters`, you will need to remove this setting, but also change the following configurations:

| Deprecated config key                   | Change
| --- | --- |
| `security.headers.filter.enabled=true`         | Just remove - this is the default
| `security.headers.filter.enabled=false`        | Replace with `play.filters.disabled += "play.filters.headers.SecurityHeadersFilter"`
| `bootstrap.filters.csrf.enabled=true`          | Just remove - this is the default
| `bootstrap.filters.csrf.enabled=false`         | Replace with  `play.filters.disabled += "play.filters.csrf.CSRFFilter"`
| `bootstrap.filters.sessionId.enabled=true`     | Replace with  `play.filters.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.frontend.filters.SessionIdFilter"`
| `bootstrap.filters.sessionId.enabled=false`    | Just remove - this is the default
| `bootstrap.filters.allowlist.enabled=true`     | Replace with  `play.filters.enabled += "uk.gov.hmrc.play.bootstrap.frontend.filters.AllowlistFilter"`
| `bootstrap.filters.allowlist.enabled=false`    | Just remove - this is the default

If you have set `play.http.filters` to a custom filter, we recommend that you remove this, and use `play.filters.enabled` instead. You can append extra filters with `play.filters.enabled += ` or remove filters with `play.filters.disabled += `.

If you are using a custom filter which injects the `play.api.http.EnabledFilters`, or are already using the default `play.api.http.EnabledFilters`, then pay extra attention since the default `play.filters.enabled` has now been defined differently by bootstrap.


### Version 3.0.0

#### http-verbs

Http-verbs has been bumped to major version 12.0.0. See [http-verbs]("https://github.com/hmrc/http-verbs") for details.

#### configuration

The following configuration has been renamed, the previous keys are invalid and will need to be updated.

| Invalid config key                      | Should now be                           |
| --- | --- |
| httpHeadersWhitelist                    | bootstrap.http.headersAllowlist         |
| bootstrap.filters.whitelist.enabled     | bootstrap.filters.allowlist.enabled     |
| bootstrap.filters.whitelist.destination | bootstrap.filters.allowlist.destination |
| bootstrap.filters.whitelist.excluded    | bootstrap.filters.allowlist.excluded    |
| bootstrap.filters.whitelist.ips         | bootstrap.filters.allowlist.ips         |
| auditing.auditExtraHeaders              | auditing.auditSentHeaders               |

### From bootstrap-play-26

#### RunMode was removed

`run.mode` configuration will now have no effect.

Bootstrap configuration which previously supported a `RunMode` prefix now should be specified without the prefix. These are:

| Invalid Prod/Dev/Test prefix | Should now be |
| --- | --- |
| Prod.microservice.services | microservice.services |
| Prod.microservice.metrics  | microservice.metrics  |
| Prod.auditing              | auditing              |

This applies to application.conf and any configuration overrides

Note: `Environment.Mode` still works as before, and some libraries may still use that as a prefix in their keys.

#### CSRFExceptionsFilter was removed

It was deprecated in 2017, and the original use-cases no longer appear valid.

If you still need the functionality offered by this filter, please copy the code from bootstrap-play-26 into your own codebase (including the tests) and take ownership of it.
